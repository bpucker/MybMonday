## Introduction ##

The MYB transcription factors from one of the largest transcription factor families in plants. The characteristic feature of MYBs are repeat units which harbour conserved tryptophan (W) residues with a defined number of interleaved amino acid residues ([Dubos et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2010.06.005)). These repeat units determine the names of MYBs. For example, the 'R2R3 MYBs' harbour two MYB repeat units: the R2 and the R3 repeat. Especially the R2R3 clade of the MYB family is expanded in plants. Members of this family are phylogenetically assigned to groups. It is expected that members of a certain group control a specific function or process. Therefore, it is possible to transfer the knowledge about MYBs studied in one plant species to the MYBs identified in a new species. Due to the large number of MYBs, they are involved in numerous processes.

Here is a list of the expected functions of [MYBs in banana (_Musa acuminata_)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239275): (1) defense/stress response, (2) trichome branching and petal morphogenesis, (3) defense/stress response, (4) glucosinolates/camalexin, (5) suberin, (6) root development, (7) phenylpropanoid/lignin, (8) flower meristem identity, (10) abiotic stress response, flower morphogenesis, and stilbene biosynthesis, (11) photomorphogenesis, (12) anther and tapetum development, (14) axillary meristem and root growth, (15) SCW and lignin, (16) stemen/anther development, phenylpropanoid, SCW, (17) anther and trichome development, (18) SCW and lignin, (20) mucillage, lignin, and stomatal closure, (22) repressors of phenylpropanoid, sinapata, lignin, (23) general flavonoid biosynthesis and trichome development, (24) anthocyanins (monocots), (25) proanthocyanins, (27) flavonoid repressors, (28) trichome development, roothair development, floral organ development, (29) anthocyanins and betalains (dicots), (30) flavonols and phlobaphene, (31) cell cycle regulation, (33) phenylpropanoid and lignin, (34) stamen development, (35) defense and stress response, (36) leaf, shoot, germ morphogenesis, (37) anther development and stress response, (38) embryogenesis and seed maturation, (39) guard cell division and root gravitropism, (40) stress response and hormone signaling, (41) stress tolerance, and (42) cell wall, lignin, seed oil,axillary meristem. The phylogenetic relationship of these MYBs is displayed in Fig. 1.

In addition to the R2R3 MYBs, there are also [MYB3R (cell cycle control)](https://dev.biologists.org/content/134/6/1101), [MYB4R (SNAP complex)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJnMGJ6vruAhWLyaQKHc3rAysQFjABegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fplphys%2Fadvance-article-pdf%2Fdoi%2F10.1093%2Fplphys%2Fkiaa067%2F35063342%2Fkiaa067.pdf&usg=AOvVaw04BwHFjy1QcAHg9-k5KeOO), and various others. However, these lineages have not expanded substantially in plants.

This tweet serves as an introduction. Please read the introduction section on top of this page for additional information. The phylogenetic tree shows the diversity of different functions that are regulated by MYB transcription factors. It appears that there are cases of convergent evolution i.e. different clades of MYBs regulating the same process.


### (2) MYB repeat structure ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1363858585768263686">TWEET</a>:_** Characteristic feature of MYBs are conserved tryptophan residues at defined positions in MYB repeat units. Names of MYBs are based on these MYB repeats e.g. 'R2R3-MYBs' harbour one R2 and one R3 repeat. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/2ZBfWOD)

</a>


These characteristic repeat features can be harnessed for the identification of MYBs in transcriptome or genome assemblies. Regular expressions can be used to search for this amino acid pattern in a given set of peptide sequences. Many genome-wide studies of R2R3-MYBs use the presence of this conserved domain to select their candidates.


### (3) MYBs interact with bHLH and WD40 (MBW complex) ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1366274503207227392">TWEET</a>:_** Some MYBs form complexes with bHLH and WD40 proteins. These complexes are named MBW after the 3 involved TFs. MBW controls the seed coat colour in Arabidopsis thaliana and other developmental processes. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/2ZCoswD)

</a>


Different MYBs and bHLHs can be involved in the MBW complex formation. The integration of different TFs allows specificity for different target genes. This complex is not only required for the regulation of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, but also plays a role in the development of trichomes and root hairs.

### (4) MYBs are breeding targets ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1368811218014629888">TWEET</a>:_** MYBs are the target of breeding projects to improve fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants.

As transcriptional regulators of entire biosnythesis pathways, MYBs are promising targets of breeding projects. The deactivation of a specific MYB and be used to shut down a pathway leading to undesired products. Additionally, the contruction of genetically modified plants, e.g. overexpressing certains MYBs, is an option to improve the crop quality by up-regulating desired pathways.

</a>


This loss-of-function allele of MYB10-2 needs to be present in a homozygous state to cause the white phenotype as it is not dominant negative. Interesting about the MYB10-2 is the lack of introns wich suggest that it originates from a reverse transcription event. It will be exciting to completely resolve the story about the anthocyanins regulating MYBs in various strawberry strains. It is also a remarkable example of pathway inactivation through loss of a regulator. This is frequently observed in the flavonoid biosynthesis. One reason could be the involvement of structural genes in multiple branches of the pathway. The loss of the anthocyanin specific regulator only inactivaites one function, while loss of the structural gene would break multiple branches.

### (9) Betalain biosynthesis in sugar beet is controlled by BvMYB1 ###

</a>

Anthocyanin and betalains are (to some extent) functionally redundant. Not a single plant species was detected to show pigmentation by anthocyanins and betalains which lead to the mutual exclusion theory ([Timoneda et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980)). BvMYB1 is an ortholog of the anthocyanin regulator PAP1. The co-option of this anthocyanin regulator by the betalain biosynthesis makes the complex pigment evolution in the Caryophyllales even more exciting. In contrast to PAP1, BvMYB1 does not require a bHLH and TTG1 cofactor to activate the betalain biosynthesis. The loss of an anthocyanin regulator to the betalain biosynthesis could be one explanation why anthocyanins have been replaced by betalains in sugar beet.


### (10) Flavonol regulator BvMYB12 ###

Flavonols protect plants against UV light and ROS, but also regulate developmental processes. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/3dSMgVo)

</a>

While betalains replace anthocyanins in many Caryophyllales families ([Timoneda et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980)), flavonols are still present in all Caryophyllales lineages. The flavonol biosynthesis is an evolutionary old pathway which appears to be conserved across all land plant lineages. The identificaiton of the AtMYB ortholog BvMYB12, which is also a flavonol biosynthesis regulator, indicates that the regulation of this pathway is also conserved over long phylogenetic distances.


### (11) Structure of WEREWOLF ###

</a>

WEREWOLF (WER) is an important regulator in the plant ontogenesis [Lee & Schiefelbein, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81536-6). Generally, cis-elements of R2R3-MYBs can be assigned to the (C/T)AACNG or the ACC(A/T)A(A/C) group. A recent study by [Wang et al., 2019](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/460/5626523) investigated the structure of WER and the interaction with cis-elements: The third alpha-helices of R2 and R3 repeats of WEREWOLF fit in the major groove of the DNA and recognize AACNGC. K55, N106, N109, and N110 are required for WER function. The L59 of WER is probably involved in sensig DNA methylation at 5mC. This 5mC methylation or a 6mA methylation in the AAC element might be able to prevent the interaction of WER and the DNA. L59 is a substitution in WER compared to MsMyb, TvMyb1, and TvMyb3. The L59A mutant shows almost the same affinity to methylated and unmethylated binding sites.

A recent publication by [Zhu et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233375) describes MYB2 of Boehmeria nivea (Ramie) as regulator of Cadmium (Cd) tolerance and accumulation. BnMYB2 is an ortholog of GmMYB176, StMYB1R-1, AtMYBS3, OsMYBS1, and OsMYBS2. This clade is characterized by a conserved SHAQKYF motif. Heterologous expression of BnMYB2 in A. thaliana seem to increase the Cd tolerance and accumulation significantly. Would the expression of other MYBs e.g. AtMYBS3 result in a similar effect?

Subgroup 6 R2R3-MYBs control floral color in Aristolochiaceae
[Munoz-Gomez et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.633227) report that the Aristolochiaceae are characterized by a huge diversity of flower coloration and forms. While the subgroup 6 of the R2R3-MYBs is generally responsible for regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis (which includes colourful anthocyanins), there are several lineage-specific MYB gene duplications which cause alterations in the activity of regulated biosynthesis pathways. These TF differences result ultimately in the diversity of flower colors through different activation of pigment pathways. The authors investigated the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes in multiple species. No F3'5'H was detected in the transcriptome analyses which is in line with the absence of blue pigmented flowers. DFR and ANS were not detected in some of the datasets which would indicate that no anthocyanins are produced in the investigated tissues.

[Rodrigues et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41438-021-00514-1) identified functional variation in the C-terminal region of anthocyanin-activating MYBs. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are located in regions of intrinsic disorder of transcription factors. They are often short linear motifs (SLiMs) of 3-11 amino acid residues with evolutionary variability, but some consereved residues which determine specificity in interactions [Stracke et al., 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11597504/). Flexibility in these regions is considered an important factor in the evolution of signalling pathways by interacting co-factors. Multiple subgroups of the MYBs interact with bHLH transcription factors, but the involved motifs evolved convergently in the C-terminal region (subgroup 4 and subgroup 12) or in the N-terminal region (subgroups 5, 6, 15, 16). Anthocyanin regulating MYBs are located in subgroup 6. The C-terminal motif in this subgroup overlaps with the TAS4-siRNA81(-) target sequence. The PA and anthocyanin regulation subgroups 5 und 6 appear to be derived from the flavonoid regulator subgroup 7. However, early branching members in the subgroup 6 are not able to activate anthocyanins or lead only to a weak activation. Functionally characterized subgroup 6 members show conservation of three short motifs in their C-terminal region.


### (15) MYB involved in sex determination ###

Dioecy has evolved hundreds of times independently from hermaphrody in plants. [Harkess et al., 2020](http://www.plantcell.org/content/32/6/1790) present a MYB that is involved in sex determination in _Asparagus officinalis_. The X and Y chromosomes of A. officinalis evolved from an ancestral autosome pair during the shift from hermaphroditism to dioecy. A loss of recombination in a Y chromosomal region with genes supressing the female organogenesis (_SOFF_) and promoting male function (_TDF1_) can be caused by hemizygosity. Two Y-speficific genes appear sufficient for sex determination. The analysis of different mutant lines revealed a 1Mbp region on the Y-chromosome that is responsible for the sex determination. One of the genes in this region is the R2R3-MYB transcription factor _DEFECTIVE IN TAPETAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION_ (_TDF1_). Interestingly, this gene is not sex linked in all dioceious Asparagus species which indicates that this sex determination mechanism evolved within the genus. Sex chromosome evolution often leads to the accumulation of male genes on the Y chromosome and female genes on the X chromsome. One example of an X-linked gene is _WIP2/NTT_ which is specificly expressed in ovules.


### (16) MYBC1 in kiwifruit ###

[Peng et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70977-0) present MYBC1 and WRKY44 as activators of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Both transcription factors appear to activate F3'H and F3'5'H as well as the proanthocyanidin biosnythesis genes. The authors present that an increased hydroxylation (via F3'H and F3'5'H) increases the flux into the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis which competes with the anthocyanin biosynthesis for substrate. Member of the MYB subgroup 6 are usually activating the anthocyanin biosynthesis. However, MYBC1 belongs to the subgroup 5. Peng et al. used RNA-Seq of differently pigmented kiwifruit cultivars to identify the underlying genes. Transient overexpression of two candidate genes, MYBC1 and WRKY44, in tobacco caused accumulation of the anthocyanin in patches. MYBC1 overexpression leads to cyanidin-based and delphinidin-based anthocyanin, while WRKY44 overexpression only caused the accumulation of cyanidin-based anthocyanins.
Overexpression in calli revealed differences between MYB110 (anthocyanin actiator) and MYBC1/WRKY44. While MYB110 activates the F3GT which is required for anthocyanin biosynthesis, MYBC1/WRKY44 actiate the F3'H/F3'5'H and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes. Since the MYBC1/WRKY44 overexpression results in higher proanthocyanidin content, the authors speculate that both TFs might be PA regulators rather than general activators of the flavonoid biosynthesis.



### (17) Evolution of the R2R3-MYBs in plants ###

> **_<a href="https://github.com/bpucker/MybMonday">TWEET</a>:_** Ancestral land plants already exhibited 10 subfamilies of R2R3-MYBs. Orthologs of 7 subfamilies were detected in chlorophytes and charophycean algae. #MybMonday (details: )


A phylogenetic anaylysis by [Jiang & Rao, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.01082) revealed 10 subfamilies of R2R3-MYBs in the ancestral land plants. Seven of these subfamilies have orthologs in the chlorophytes and charophycean algae. Different subfamilies of the MYB expanded in different plant lineages. Whole genome duplication alone cannot explain this pattern. Chlorophyta (<13) and streptophyte alga _Klebsormidium nitens_ (22) have small numbers of MYBs, while land plants have generally a larger number. About half of the land plant R2R3-MYBs fall into subfamily VIII, which is the main contributor to the expansion of R2R3-MYBs in land plants. This study supports the hypothesis that the R1R2R3-MYBs are not the result of R2R3-MYBs gaining an additional repeat.
The authors point out some issues when investigating the evolution of MYBs:
(1) R2R3-MYBs have been classified into 23-90 subgroups thus there is little consensus regarding their classification schemes. Therefore, Jiang & Rao propose a new classification scheme which better reflects the asymmetric evolution of R2R3-MYBs in land plants and is restricted to monophyletic groups.
(2) Phylogenetic anlysis are impacted by the quality of the annotations of studied species. The numbers of R2R3-MYBs might be underestimated in some species.
