## Introduction ##

The MYB transcription factors from one of the largest transcription factor families in plants. The characteristic feature of MYBs are repeat units which harbour conserved tryptophan (W) residues with a defined number of interleaved amino acid residues ([Dubos et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2010.06.005)). These repeat units determine the names of MYBs. For example, the 'R2R3 MYBs' harbour two MYB repeat units: the R2 and the R3 repeat. Especially the R2R3 clade of the MYB family is expanded in plants. Members of this family are phylogenetically assigned to groups. It is expected that members of a certain group control a specific function or process. Therefore, it is possible to transfer the knowledge about MYBs studied in one plant species to the MYBs identified in a new species. Due to the large number of MYBs, they are involved in numerous processes.

Here is a list of the expected functions of [MYBs in banana (_Musa acuminata_)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239275): (1) defense/stress response, (2) trichome branching and petal morphogenesis, (3) defense/stress response, (4) glucosinolates/camalexin, (5) suberin, (6) root development, (7) phenylpropanoid/lignin, (8) flower meristem identity, (10) abiotic stress response, flower morphogenesis, and stilbene biosynthesis, (11) photomorphogenesis, (12) anther and tapetum development, (14) axillary meristem and root growth, (15) SCW and lignin, (16) stemen/anther development, phenylpropanoid, SCW, (17) anther and trichome development, (18) SCW and lignin, (20) mucillage, lignin, and stomatal closure, (22) repressors of phenylpropanoid, sinapata, lignin, (23) general flavonoid biosynthesis and trichome development, (24) anthocyanins (monocots), (25) proanthocyanins, (27) flavonoid repressors, (28) trichome development, roothair development, floral organ development, (29) anthocyanins and betalains (dicots), (30) flavonols and phlobaphene, (31) cell cycle regulation, (33) phenylpropanoid and lignin, (34) stamen development, (35) defense and stress response, (36) leaf, shoot, germ morphogenesis, (37) anther development and stress response, (38) embryogenesis and seed maturation, (39) guard cell division and root gravitropism, (40) stress response and hormone signaling, (41) stress tolerance, and (42) cell wall, lignin, seed oil,axillary meristem. The phylogenetic relationship of these MYBs is displayed in Fig. 1.

In addition to the R2R3 MYBs, there are also [MYB3R (cell cycle control)](https://dev.biologists.org/content/134/6/1101), [MYB4R (SNAP complex)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJnMGJ6vruAhWLyaQKHc3rAysQFjABegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fplphys%2Fadvance-article-pdf%2Fdoi%2F10.1093%2Fplphys%2Fkiaa067%2F35063342%2Fkiaa067.pdf&usg=AOvVaw04BwHFjy1QcAHg9-k5KeOO), and various others. However, these lineages have not expanded substantially in plants.

### (2) MYB repeat structure ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1363858585768263686">TWEET</a>:_** Characteristic feature of MYBs are conserved tryptophan residues at defined positions in MYB repeat units. Names of MYBs are based on these MYB repeats e.g. 'R2R3-MYBs' harbour one R2 and one R3 repeat. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/2ZBfWOD)

These characteristic repeat features can be harnessed for the identification of MYBs in transcriptome or genome assemblies. Regular expressions can be used to search for this amino acid pattern in a given set of peptide sequences.


### (3) MYBs interact with bHLH and WD40 (MBW complex) ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1366274503207227392">TWEET</a>:_** Some MYBs form complexes with bHLH and WD40 proteins. These complexes are named MBW after the 3 involved TFs. MBW controls the seed coat colour in Arabidopsis thaliana and other developmental processes. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/2ZCoswD)

</a>


Different MYBs and bHLHs can be involved in the MBW complex formation. The integration of different TFs allows specificity for different target genes. This complex is not only required for the regulation of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, but also plays a role in the development of trichomes and root hairs.

### (4) MYBs are breeding targets ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1368811218014629888">TWEET</a>:_** MYBs are the target of breeding projects to improve fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants. MYB1/10/110a are responsible for the red coloration of apple skin, foliage & fruit-flesh, respectively, by activating a pigment biosynthesis  #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/37OrRgb)

</a>


As transcriptional regulators of entire biosnythesis pathways, MYBs are promising targets of breeding projects. The deactivation of a specific MYB and be used to shut down a pathway leading to undesired products. Additionally, the contruction of genetically modified plants, e.g. overexpressing certains MYBs, is an option to improve the crop quality by up-regulating desired pathways.

### (6) Red and white strawberries ###

A 8bp insertion in the CDS of FaMYB10 can change the colour from red to white through a single loss-of-function allele. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/2ZUIGBV)

</a>


This loss-of-function allele of MYB10-2 needs to be present in a homozygous state to cause the white phenotype as it is not dominant negative. Interesting about the MYB10-2 is the lack of introns wich suggest that it originates from a reverse transcription event. It will be exciting to completely resolve the story about the anthocyanins regulating MYBs in various strawberry strains. It is also a remarkable example of pathway inactivation through loss of a regulator. This is frequently observed in the flavonoid biosynthesis. One reason could be the involvement of structural genes in multiple branches of the pathway. The loss of the anthocyanin specific regulator only inactivaites one function, while loss of the structural gene would break multiple branches.


### (7) Colouration of kiwi fruit tissues ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1376406263693783042">TWEET</a>:_** The red colour of kiwifruit petals is determined by MYB110a, but there might be more MYBs involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation in other tissues. A microsatellite marker linked to MYB110a revealed the location on chr10. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/3aVRWvZ)

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1378942978253807616">TWEET</a>:_** Consumers prefer apricots with red blushed skin. Expression of PaMYB10 correlates with expression of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes which are responsible for production of red pigments. PaMYB10 seems to be an important activator. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/2ZXbWbo)

### (11) Structure of WEREWOLF ###

> **_<a href="https://github.com/bpucker/MybMonday">TWEET</a>:_** Third alpha-helices of R2 and R3 repeats of WEREWOLF fit in the major groove of the DNA and recognize AACNGC. L59 of WER is probably sensing the methylation status of the binding site. #MybMonday (details: https://bit.ly/3nmpR5n)


WEREWOLF (WER) is an important regulator in the plant ontogenesis [Lee & Schiefelbein, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81536-6). Generally, cis-elements of R2R3-MYBs can be assigned to the (C/T)AACNG or the ACC(A/T)A(A/C) group. A recent study by [Wang et al., 2019](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/460/5626523) investigated the structure of WER and the interaction with cis-elements: The third alpha-helices of R2 and R3 repeats of WEREWOLF fit in the major groove of the DNA and recognize AACNGC. K55, N106, N109, and N110 are required for WER function. The L59 of WER is probably involved in sensig DNA methylation at 5mC. This 5mC methylation or a 6mA methylation in the AAC element might be able to prevent the interaction of WER and the DNA. L59 is a substitution in WER compared to MsMyb, TvMyb1, and TvMyb3. The L59A mutant shows almost the same affinity to methylated and unmethylated binding sites.
