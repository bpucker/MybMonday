## Introduction ##

MYB transcription factors are among the largest transcription factor families in plants. Especially the R2R3 clades expanded in plants. Members of this family are phylogenetically assigned to groups. It is expected that members of a group control a specific function or process. Due to the large number of MYBs, numerous processes are controlled by them.

Here is a list of the expected functions of [MYBs in banana (_Musa acuminata_)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239275): (1) defense/stress response, (2) trichome branching and petal morphogenesis, (3) defense/stress response, (4) glucosinolates/camalexin, (5) suberin, (6) root development, (7) phenylpropanoid/lignin, (8) flower meristem identity, (10) abiotic stress response, flower morphogenesis, and stilbene biosynthesis, (11) photomorphogenesis, (12) anther and tapetum development, (14) axillary meristem and root growth, (15) SCW and lignin, (16) stemen/anther development, phenylpropanoid, SCW, (17) anther and trichome development, (18) SCW and lignin, (20) mucillage, lignin, and stomatal closure, (22) repressors of phenylpropanoid, sinapata, lignin, (23) general flavonoid biosynthesis and trichome development, (24) anthocyanins (monocots), (25) proanthocyanins, (27) flavonoid repressors, (28) trichome development, roothair development, floral organ development, (29) anthocyanins and betalains (dicots), (30) flavonols and phlobaphene, (31) cell cycle regulation, (33) phenylpropanoid and lignin, (34) stamen development, (35) defense and stress response, (36) leaf, shoot, germ morphogenesis, (37) anther development and stress response, (38) embryogenesis and seed maturation, (39) guard cell division and root gravitropism, (40) stress response and hormone signaling, (41) stress tolerance, and (42) cell wall, lignin, seed oil,axillary meristem.

In addition to the R2R3 MYBs, there are also MYB3R (cell cycle control), [MYB4R (SNAP complex)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJnMGJ6vruAhWLyaQKHc3rAysQFjABegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fplphys%2Fadvance-article-pdf%2Fdoi%2F10.1093%2Fplphys%2Fkiaa067%2F35063342%2Fkiaa067.pdf&usg=AOvVaw04BwHFjy1QcAHg9-k5KeOO), and various others. However, these lineages have not expanded substantially in plants.
