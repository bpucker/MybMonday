MYB transcription factors are one of the largest gene family in plants and control many processes. This repository provides additional background to the #MYB_Monday tweets. #MybMonday is maintained by the [PuckerLab](https://www.tu-braunschweig.de/en/ifp/pbb) at TU Braunschweig.

## Introduction ##

The MYB transcription factors from one of the largest transcription factor families in plants. The characteristic feature of MYBs are repeat units which harbour conserved tryptophan (W) residues with a defined number of interleaved amino acid residues ([Dubos et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tplants.2010.06.005)). These repeat units determine the names of MYBs. For example, the 'R2R3 MYBs' harbour two MYB repeat units: the R2 and the R3 repeat. Especially the R2R3 clade of the MYB family is expanded in plants. Members of this family are phylogenetically assigned to groups. It is expected that members of a certain group control a specific function or process. Therefore, it is possible to transfer the knowledge about MYBs studied in one plant species to the MYBs identified in a new species. Due to the large number of MYBs, they are involved in numerous processes.

Here is a list of the expected functions of [MYBs in banana (_Musa acuminata_)](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239275): (1) defense/stress response, (2) trichome branching and petal morphogenesis, (3) defense/stress response, (4) glucosinolates/camalexin, (5) suberin, (6) root development, (7) phenylpropanoid/lignin, (8) flower meristem identity, (10) abiotic stress response, flower morphogenesis, and stilbene biosynthesis, (11) photomorphogenesis, (12) anther and tapetum development, (14) axillary meristem and root growth, (15) SCW and lignin, (16) stemen/anther development, phenylpropanoid, SCW, (17) anther and trichome development, (18) SCW and lignin, (20) mucillage, lignin, and stomatal closure, (22) repressors of phenylpropanoid, sinapata, lignin, (23) general flavonoid biosynthesis and trichome development, (24) anthocyanins (monocots), (25) proanthocyanins, (27) flavonoid repressors, (28) trichome development, roothair development, floral organ development, (29) anthocyanins and betalains (dicots), (30) flavonols and phlobaphene, (31) cell cycle regulation, (33) phenylpropanoid and lignin, (34) stamen development, (35) defense and stress response, (36) leaf, shoot, germ morphogenesis, (37) anther development and stress response, (38) embryogenesis and seed maturation, (39) guard cell division and root gravitropism, (40) stress response and hormone signaling, (41) stress tolerance, and (42) cell wall, lignin, seed oil,axillary meristem.

In addition to the R2R3 MYBs, there are also [MYB3R (cell cycle control)](https://dev.biologists.org/content/134/6/1101), [MYB4R (SNAP complex)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjJnMGJ6vruAhWLyaQKHc3rAysQFjABegQIBBAD&url=https%3A%2F%2Facademic.oup.com%2Fplphys%2Fadvance-article-pdf%2Fdoi%2F10.1093%2Fplphys%2Fkiaa067%2F35063342%2Fkiaa067.pdf&usg=AOvVaw04BwHFjy1QcAHg9-k5KeOO), and various others. However, these lineages have not expanded substantially in plants.

This tweet serves as an introduction. Please read the introduction section on top of this page for additional information. The phylogenetic tree shows the diversity of different functions that are regulated by MYB transcription factors. It appears that there are cases of convergent evolution i.e. different clades of MYBs regulating the same process.


### (2) MYB repeat structure ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1363858585768263686">TWEET</a>:_** Characteristic feature of MYBs are conserved tryptophan residues at defined positions in MYB repeat units. Names of MYBs are based on these MYB repeats e.g. 'R2R3-MYBs' harbour one R2 and one R3 repeat. #MybMonday (src: https://bit.ly/2ZBfWOD)

</a>


These characteristic repeat features can be harnessed for the identification of MYBs in transcriptome or genome assemblies. Regular expressions can be used to search for this amino acid pattern in a given set of peptide sequences. Many genome-wide studies of R2R3-MYBs use the presence of this conserved domain to select their candidates.


### (3) MYBs interact with bHLH and WD40 (MBW complex) ###

</a>


Different MYBs and bHLHs can be involved in the MBW complex formation. The integration of different TFs allows specificity for different target genes. This complex is not only required for the regulation of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, but also plays a role in the development of trichomes and root hairs.

### (4) MYBs are breeding targets ###

> **_<a href="https://twitter.com/boas_pucker/status/1368811218014629888">TWEET</a>:_** MYBs are the target of breeding projects to improve fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants.

As transcriptional regulators of entire biosnythesis pathways, MYBs are promising targets of breeding projects. The deactivation of a specific MYB and be used to shut down a pathway leading to undesired products. Additionally, the contruction of genetically modified plants, e.g. overexpressing certain MYBs, is an option to improve the crop quality by up-regulating desired pathways.

</a>


This loss-of-function allele of MYB10-2 needs to be present in a homozygous state to cause the white phenotype as it is not dominant negative. Interesting about the MYB10-2 is the lack of introns wich suggest that it originates from a reverse transcription event. It will be exciting to completely resolve the story about the anthocyanins regulating MYBs in various strawberry strains. It is also a remarkable example of pathway inactivation through loss of a regulator. This is frequently observed in the flavonoid biosynthesis. One reason could be the involvement of structural genes in multiple branches of the pathway. The loss of the anthocyanin specific regulator only inactivaites one function, while loss of the structural gene would break multiple branches.

### (9) Betalain biosynthesis in sugar beet is controlled by BvMYB1 ###

</a>

Anthocyanin and betalains are (to some extent) functionally redundant. Not a single plant species was detected to show pigmentation by anthocyanins and betalains which lead to the mutual exclusion theory ([Timoneda et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980)). BvMYB1 is an ortholog of the anthocyanin regulator PAP1. The co-option of this anthocyanin regulator by the betalain biosynthesis makes the complex pigment evolution in the Caryophyllales even more exciting. In contrast to PAP1, BvMYB1 does not require a bHLH and TTG1 cofactor to activate the betalain biosynthesis. The loss of an anthocyanin regulator to the betalain biosynthesis could be one explanation why anthocyanins have been replaced by betalains in sugar beet.

</a>

(Figure source: [Stracke et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-014-0249-8))

While betalains replace anthocyanins in many Caryophyllales families ([Timoneda et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980)), flavonols are still present in all Caryophyllales lineages. The flavonol biosynthesis is an evolutionary old pathway which appears to be conserved across all land plant lineages. The identificaiton of the AtMYB ortholog BvMYB12, which is also a flavonol biosynthesis regulator, indicates that the regulation of this pathway is also conserved over long phylogenetic distances.

</a>

WEREWOLF (WER) is an important regulator in the plant ontogenesis [Lee & Schiefelbein, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)81536-6). Generally, cis-elements of R2R3-MYBs can be assigned to the (C/T)AACNG or the ACC(A/T)A(A/C) group. A recent study by [Wang et al., 2019](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/1/460/5626523) investigated the structure of WER and the interaction with cis-elements: The third alpha-helices of R2 and R3 repeats of WEREWOLF fit in the major groove of the DNA and recognize AACNGC. K55, N106, N109, and N110 are required for WER function. The L59 of WER is probably involved in sensig DNA methylation at 5mC. This 5mC methylation or a 6mA methylation in the AAC element might be able to prevent the interaction of WER and the DNA. L59 is a substitution in WER compared to MsMyb, TvMyb1, and TvMyb3. The L59A mutant shows almost the same affinity to methylated and unmethylated binding sites.

A recent publication by [Zhu et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233375) describes MYB2 of Boehmeria nivea (Ramie) as regulator of Cadmium (Cd) tolerance and accumulation. BnMYB2 is an ortholog of GmMYB176, StMYB1R-1, AtMYBS3, OsMYBS1, and OsMYBS2. This clade is characterized by a conserved SHAQKYF motif. Heterologous expression of BnMYB2 in A. thaliana seem to increase the Cd tolerance and accumulation significantly. Would the expression of other MYBs e.g. AtMYBS3 result in a similar effect?

Subgroup 6 R2R3-MYBs control floral color in Aristolochiaceae
[Munoz-Gomez et al.](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2021.633227) report that the Aristolochiaceae are characterized by a huge diversity of flower coloration and forms. While the subgroup 6 of the R2R3-MYBs is generally responsible for regulation of the flavonoid biosynthesis (which includes colourful anthocyanins), there are several lineage-specific MYB gene duplications which cause alterations in the activity of regulated biosynthesis pathways. These TF differences result ultimately in the diversity of flower colors through different activation of pigment pathways. The authors investigated the expression of flavonoid biosynthesis genes in multiple species. No F3'5'H was detected in the transcriptome analyses which is in line with the absence of blue pigmented flowers. DFR and ANS were not detected in some of the datasets which would indicate that no anthocyanins are produced in the investigated tissues.

[Rodrigues et al., 2021](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41438-021-00514-1) identified functional variation in the C-terminal region of anthocyanin-activating MYBs. Molecular recognition features (MoRFs) are located in regions of intrinsic disorder of transcription factors. They are often short linear motifs (SLiMs) of 3-11 amino acid residues with evolutionary variability, but some consereved residues which determine specificity in interactions [Stracke et al., 2001](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11597504/). Flexibility in these regions is considered an important factor in the evolution of signalling pathways by interacting co-factors. Multiple subgroups of the MYBs interact with bHLH transcription factors, but the involved motifs evolved convergently in the C-terminal region (subgroup 4 and subgroup 12) or in the N-terminal region (subgroups 5, 6, 15, 16). Anthocyanin regulating MYBs are located in subgroup 6. The C-terminal motif in this subgroup overlaps with the TAS4-siRNA81(-) target sequence. The PA and anthocyanin regulation subgroups 5 und 6 appear to be derived from the flavonoid regulator subgroup 7. However, early branching members in the subgroup 6 are not able to activate anthocyanins or lead only to a weak activation. Functionally characterized subgroup 6 members show conservation of three short motifs in their C-terminal region.

Dioecy has evolved hundreds of times independently from hermaphrody in plants. [Harkess et al., 2020](http://www.plantcell.org/content/32/6/1790) present a MYB that is involved in sex determination in _Asparagus officinalis_. The X and Y chromosomes of A. officinalis evolved from an ancestral autosome pair during the shift from hermaphroditism to dioecy. A loss of recombination in a Y chromosomal region with genes supressing the female organogenesis (_SOFF_) and promoting male function (_TDF1_) can be caused by hemizygosity. Two Y-speficific genes appear sufficient for sex determination. The analysis of different mutant lines revealed a 1Mbp region on the Y-chromosome that is responsible for the sex determination. One of the genes in this region is the R2R3-MYB transcription factor _DEFECTIVE IN TAPETAL DEVELOPMENT AND FUNCTION_ (_TDF1_). Interestingly, this gene is not sex linked in all dioceious Asparagus species which indicates that this sex determination mechanism evolved within the genus. Sex chromosome evolution often leads to the accumulation of male genes on the Y chromosome and female genes on the X chromsome. One example of an X-linked gene is _WIP2/NTT_ which is specificly expressed in ovules.

[Peng et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-70977-0) present MYBC1 and WRKY44 as activators of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis. Both transcription factors appear to activate F3'H and F3'5'H as well as the proanthocyanidin biosnythesis genes. The authors present that an increased hydroxylation (via F3'H and F3'5'H) increases the flux into the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis which competes with the anthocyanin biosynthesis for substrate. Member of the MYB subgroup 6 are usually activating the anthocyanin biosynthesis. However, MYBC1 belongs to the subgroup 5. Peng et al. used RNA-Seq of differently pigmented kiwifruit cultivars to identify the underlying genes. Transient overexpression of two candidate genes, MYBC1 and WRKY44, in tobacco caused accumulation of the anthocyanin in patches. MYBC1 overexpression leads to cyanidin-based and delphinidin-based anthocyanin, while WRKY44 overexpression only caused the accumulation of cyanidin-based anthocyanins.
Overexpression in calli revealed differences between MYB110 (anthocyanin actiator) and MYBC1/WRKY44. While MYB110 activates the F3GT which is required for anthocyanin biosynthesis, MYBC1/WRKY44 actiate the F3'H/F3'5'H and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes. Since the MYBC1/WRKY44 overexpression results in higher proanthocyanidin content, the authors speculate that both TFs might be PA regulators rather than general activators of the flavonoid biosynthesis.

A phylogenetic anaylysis by [Jiang & Rao, 2020](https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.19.01082) revealed 10 subfamilies of R2R3-MYBs in the ancestral land plants. Seven of these subfamilies have orthologs in the chlorophytes and charophycean algae. Different subfamilies of the MYB expanded in different plant lineages. Whole genome duplication alone cannot explain this pattern. Chlorophyta (<13) and streptophyte alga _Klebsormidium nitens_ (22) have small numbers of MYBs, while land plants have generally a larger number. About half of the land plant R2R3-MYBs fall into subfamily VIII, which is the main contributor to the expansion of R2R3-MYBs in land plants. This study supports the hypothesis that the R1R2R3-MYBs are not the result of R2R3-MYBs gaining an additional repeat.
The authors point out some issues when investigating the evolution of MYBs:
(1) R2R3-MYBs have been classified into 23-90 subgroups thus there is little consensus regarding their classification schemes. Therefore, Jiang & Rao propose a new classification scheme which better reflects the asymmetric evolution of R2R3-MYBs in land plants and is restricted to monophyletic groups.
(2) Phylogenetic anlysis are impacted by the quality of the annotations of studied species. The numbers of R2R3-MYBs might be underestimated in some species.

Plants need a sophisticated regulatory system to balance the flux of sulfur into glucosinolate (GSL) biosynthesis and central metabolism. MYB34, MYB51, and MYB122 control the indolic GSL (IG) biosynthesis, while MYB28, MYB29, and MYB76 control the aliphatic GSL (AG) biosynthesis. These MYBs also enhance sulfur assimilation through activation of the respective genes. IG molecules contain 2 sulfur atoms in their backbone, while AG molecules contain 3 sulfur atoms in their backbone. [Frerigmann & Gigolashvili, 2014](https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2014.00626) studied the role of R2R3-MYBs under sulfur deficiency. Previous studies had identified that sulfur assimilation pathway genes are up-regulated under sulfur deficiency and that GSL biosynthesis is reduced. Catabolism of GSL is one solution how sulfur can be made available in the cell again.

Sulfur Limitation 1 (SLIM1) was identified as a negative transcriptional regulator of MYB29 and MYB76. SLIM1 reduces the activities of both promoters in a trans-activation assay. Sulfur deficiency resulted in a reduction of the AG content. The biosynthesis of AGs might require a tighter regulation than the IG biosnythesis, because the AG molecules contain one additional sulfur atom compared to IGs. However, a 'low GSL signal' seems to prevent the SLIM1-based repression of the MYB29 and MYB76 expression. This was investigated in mutant plants with a block in the GSL biosynthesis. The authors speculate that a complete down-regulation of the MYBs is not possible, because the six MYBs are activating sulfur assimilarion genes in addition to the GLS biosnythesis. There are multiple scenarios which could explain the observed results and further research on the topic is required.


### (19) VvMYB86 - activator of PA and repressor of anthocyanin biosynthesis ###

[Cheng et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2020.613677/full) characterized the Vitis vinifera MYB86 through in vivo and in vitro experiments. It turns out that this MYB is a positive regulator of LAR, which is involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis. LAR and ANR are the two enzymes of the PA biosynthesis. While ANR determines the total amount of proanthocyanidins, LAR determines the degree of PA polymerisation. While upregulating LAR, this VvMYB86 represses ANS and UFGT, which are involved in anthocyanin formation. Most previously characterized V. vinifera MYBs are dedicated regulators of one of the pathways. However, MYB5 in V. vinifera and additional MYBs in other species have been identified as regulators of both pathways, but these are positive regulators of both pathways. Nevertheless, MYBs with opposite effects on both pathways have been described in other species before.
Sequence analysis of VvMYB86 revealed the presence of a bHLH interaction motif suggesting that this MYBs might be involved in a MBW complex. Protoplast transfections confirmed that MYB86 is able to activate LAR and to slightly repress ANS and UFGT promoters.

There are three anthocyanin activating MYBs in _Arabidopsis thaliana_: MYB75, MYB90, and MYB113. Trans-acting siRNA 4 (TAS4) and microRNA828 (miR828) are repressing the gene expression of these MYBs. [Koo & Poethig, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13765-020-00584-0) show that the expression of _PAP1_ (_MYB75_), _PAP2_ (_MYB90_), and _MYB113_ change over developmental stages of _A. thaliana_ leaves. TAS4 seems to be most active in young leaves. The anthocyanin content is equal in all leaves during the first 3-4 weeks, but there is a substantially higher anthocyanin concentration in apical leaves in older plants. An additional finding is that _PAP2_ might be responsible for the anthocyanin increase under nutrient-deficient conditions, because its gene expression was increased 1000-fold. Different transcript abundances of _PAP1_ and _PAP2_ could be determined by different affinities of TAS4 for both MYBs.

</a>

[Todesco et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.26.449999) investigate the regulation of the floral pigment diversity of sunflowers. Floral pigmentation is an outstanding example of adapative variation. A pattern of UV absorbing pigments cannot be seen by the human eye, but probably is crucial for the pollinator attraction. A proportion of the sunflower accessions lacks such "nectar guides" due to completely UV-absorbing ligules. This suggest that the pollinator orientation is not one of the flavonol functions in these flowers. GWAS revealed a region on Chr15 as causal for this phenotypic difference between accessions. While this region does not contain a promising candidate gene, MYB111 is located close by. MYB111 appears responsible for the flavonol formation in petals of _A. thaliana_. It seems that MYB12 is not involved in the activation of flavonol accumulation in this tissue type. The explanation is a spatial separation of _MYB111_ and _MYB12_ expression with only _MYB111_ being expressed in these tissues. _MYB111_ shows a particularly high expression in developing ligules. Huge variation in the promoter region of _MYB111_ was observed between sunflower accessions. It appears that "nectar guides" are stronger in cultivated accessions compared to the ancestral state in the wild types, which probably leads to more pollinator visits. UV-absorbing compounds could lead to temperatue increase and make the flower more attractive to pollinators, but the effect is probably neglectable. Flavonols are also involved in drought response by reducing water loss. Since evaporation results in cooling, this could be another mechanism to regulate the flower temperature.

[Wang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.3389/fgene.2020.598183) identified 108 R2R3-MYBs in Capsicum annuum. Pepper is well known for its piciness which is due to capsaicin. The authors expected a connection between the MYBs and the capsaicin biosynthesis. Gene structure, protein domain structure, and phylogenetic relationships of the MYBs were summarized in one figure. Individual MYBs were identified as co-expressed with single genes of the capsaicinoid biosynthesis, but it appears that there is no general regulator. CaMYB108 was previously identified as a capsaicin biosynthesis regulator. There might be other/additional transcriptional regulators which were not identified in this study.

[Cao et al., 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2021.691384/full) describe the genome-wide investigation of the MYB gene family in Chinese bayberry (_Morella rubra_). _M. rubra_ is a subtropical fruit tree native to China. The 174 MYBs include 122 R3R3-MYBs, 43 1R-MYBs, two 3R-MYBs, one 4R-MYB, and six atypical MYBs. Tandem duplications and larger segmental duplications contributed to the total number of observed MYBs. _M. rubra_ is known for the production of various flavonoids. Therefore, the MrMYBs involved in the flavonoid biosynthesis were investigated in detail. MrMYB12 was identified as a flavonol regulator that can activate the gene expression of _CHS_, _F3H_, and _FLS_. MrMYB39 and MrMYB58a can activate the LAR promoter indicating that they are proanthocyanin regulators.

</a>


[Zheng et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/genetics/iyaa036) investigated the coloration of flowers in the genus _Mimulus_. _MYB5a_/_NEGAN_ was previously identified as a crucial factor determining the visual diversity. _NEGAN_/_MYB5_ is part of a reaction-diffusion system in _M. lewisii_ and _M. guttatus_ that leads to spots of red anthocyanin pigmentation in the nectar guide region [Ding et al., 2020](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32155414/). Genetic mapping revealed _MYB4_ and _MYB5a_ as candidates in a QTL for anthocyanin pigmentation. Subsequent gene expression analysis showed that _MYB5a_ is the most likely candidate due to a specific expression in the petals. The yellow flowering _M. luteus luteus_ and the anthocyanin-pigmented _M. luteus variegatus_ differ by an InDel in the third exon of _MYB5a_ which excludes the subgroup 6 motif from the _M. luteus variegatus_ MYB. However, the third and the fourth exon are very similar (duplication?) suggesting that the fourth exon contributes the subgroup 6 motif. It appears that there are two different splice variants of the _MYB5_: exon1-2-4 in the anthocyanin-pigmented tissues and exon1-2-3 in other tissues. RNAi knockdown of _MYB5a_ was used to demonstrate the involvement in anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation. _MYB5a_ is an activator of its own inhibitor _RTO_.

<br>

[Li et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.07.21.453189) analazyed the R2R3-MYBs in _Camelia sinensis_ (tea plant) to find the regulator of the galloylated catechin biosynthesis. Catechins accound for 70% of the polyphenols in _C. sinensis_ and are the major health promoting factor. Most abundant are galloylated catechins (ECG and EGCG). A total of 118 R2R3-MYBs were discovered in _C. sinensis_ and presented in a phylogenetic tree with the _A. thaliana_ MYBs (Dubos et al., 2010). No tea plant MYB falls in the S12 group comprized of AtMYB28, AtMYB29, AtMYB76, AtMYB34, and AtMYB51. These are Brassicaceae-specific MYBs that regulate glucosinolate biosynthesis (Gigolashvili et al., 2007; Matus et al., 2008). Three MYB subgroups without _A. thaliana_ members were identified. The authors propose that these evolved in tea plant, but the presence of _Vitis vinifera_ MYBs in these clades suggest that they have been lost in _A. thaliana_ instead. The authors decided to focus on subgroup 5 due to expression in apical buds and young leaves where high catechin concentrations were detected. _CsMYB30_, _CsMYB34_, _CsMYB37_ and _CsMYB42_ revealed a strong co-expression with the catechin biosynthesis genes (_CsMYB32_ instead of _CsMYB42_ was observed in a validation experiment).

</a>


[Feng et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28444194/) investigated the evolution of the 3R-MYB gene family. Since most plant MYBs belong to the R2R3-MYB gene family, the other families are often neglected. It is important to note that this classification based on the presence of repeats might not reflect the phylogeny of MYBs. When investigating the function of MYBs, it should be better to focus on their phylogeny instead on the presence of repeats. 3R-MYBs are divided into three groups: A, B, and C. Synteny analysis indicates that the firsts 3R-MYB gene was amplified through segmental duplications in Amborella. Gene duplications within these lineages after the separation of monocots and dicots are the important factor that explains the large diversity seen today. The general gene structure of 3R-MYBs changed during evolution through the acquisition of additional introns.  What could have been the evolutionary advantage? There are many cases of alternative splicing, but only a small proportion seems to change the final protein. Most events appear to be unproductive splicing or are restricted to the UTR. These events might be an additional layer of gene expression regulation. Alternative splicing in the CDS could also cause the loss of a repressor motif leading to a hyperactive protein. Helix2 and helix3 encoded by a MYB repeat are binding DNA and thus more conserved. Especially helix3 does not show much variation, because this helix forms the direct contact to the DNA.

[Liu et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.08.24.457473) investigated R2R3-MYBs in pepper and present CaMYB101 as anthocyanin repressor. Some pepper cultivars accumulate anthocyanins in fruits during development and loose these pigments during fruit development. Since MYBs are important regulators of the anthocyanin biosynthesis, it is likely that they are involved in this process. This analysis is based on newly identified MYBs in _Capsicum baccatum_ and _C. chinense_ with previously identified R2R3-MYBs of _C. annuum_ from [Wang et al., 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7779616/). CaMYB101 was identified based on orthology to PhMYB27 and SlMYBL2 which have been previously been reported as anthocyanin repressors. Gene expression analysis and VIGS experiments support this prediction.

Sugar beet (_Beta vulgaris_) belongs to the large flowering plant order Caryophyllales. There are many reasons to study the MYB gene family in this species. 
Sugar beet is an important crop species in the northern hemisphere accounting for 30% of sugar production. The sugar beet genome sequence was also for a long time the only high quality genomic resource that represented the Caryophyllales. Particularly interesting is also the presence of betalains in this species while anthocyanins are absent (see [Timoneda et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1111/nph.15980) for a review). Since many MYBs are involved in the regulation of the anthocyanin/flavonoid biosynthesis, differences to other plants can be expected. The number of 70 R2R3-MYBs is small compared to other plants [(Stracke et al., 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-014-0249-8). For example, _Arabidopsis thaliana_ almost twice as many R2R3-MYBs despite the much smaller genome size. One potential explanation is the lack of recent gene duplications. For example, the BvMYB12 investigated by [Stracke et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12870-014-0249-8) does not have two recent duplications (MYB11, MYB111) as seen in _A. thaliana_.

While the number of 285 R2R3-MYBs in _Musa acuminata_ (banana) is impressive, not all of them are expressed ([Pucker et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239275)). This already indicates that some of them might be duplicates that might be purged during evolution. There are often many copies in banana matching a single copy in other species. It is possible that sub- or neofunctionalization are ongoing, but in some cases these copies might be due to the lack of a strong selection against them. However, it is also important that this analysis was restricted to the A genome ([Pucker et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0239275)) thus there should be a similar number in the B genome.

[He et al., 2019](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/1/271) identified a MYB transcription factor that confers brown planthopper (BPH) resistance to rice. BPH is one of the most destructive insects that damage rice by sucking sap from the phloem. It can also transmit viral diseases: rice grassy stunt and rugged stunt.
Several NBS-LRR resistance genes have been identified. It is known that lignin, salicylic acid, and polyphenols in general have a protective effect against insects. Enhancing the cell wall appears as an important mechanism to protect against insects. Gene expression between pools of BPH susceptible and resistant plants were compared and revealed PALs as a good candidate (OsPAL6,OsPAL8). Overexpression of these PALs confered resistance to a susceptible accession.
T-DNA knock-out of OsMYB30 resulted in a BPH susceptible line. The BPH feeding activates the expression of this MYB which activates the expression of a PAL (first step in general phenylpropanoid pathway).


### (34) DAP-Seq in grapevine ###

</a>

[Orduna et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.12.31.424746) investigated the target genes of sugroup 2 R2R3-MYBs in grapevine via DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-Seq). The subgroup 2 comprises VvMYB14 and VvMYB15 as well as the newly characterized VvMYB13. These MYBs control the stilbene pathway which gives rise to resveratol. DAP-Seq revealed that these subgroup 2 MYBs bind to the promoters of many stilbene biosynthesis genes and also other genes involved in the specialized metabolism. There is also a substantial overlap between the target genes of MYB14 and MYB15. The integration of DAP-Seq results with gene centered expression networks allowed a refinement of the target gene set. Finally, overexpression of MYB15 supported this identified set of target genes. The analysis of VvMYB13 and the comparison to AtMYB13 suggests a diversification as only the AtMYB13 appears involved in lignin biosynthesis. Surprisingly, these grapevine MYBs also bind to genes that show an expression pattern opposite to stilbene biosynthesis. This observation might suggest a negative regulation through the subgroup 2 MYBs. Cell culture experiments suggest that jasmonate shifts the metabolic flux from flavonoids to stilbenes. DAP-Seq is an additional method to identify pathways if the common regulator is already known.

</a>

[Zhang et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erab156) investigated novel group of flavonol biosynthesis regulators around MYB21. MYB11/MYB12/MYB111 are well established regulators of the flavonol biosynthesis (MYB subgroup 7). MYB21/MYB24/MYB57 were reported as additional regulators that have a different phylogenetic origin (MYB subgroup 19). A _myb21_ mutant can be rescued by overexpression of FLS or feeding of the substrate. ROS accumulation is increased in the stamen of _myb21_ mutants suggesting that flavonols are required for mediating ROS stress.

</a>

The annotation of the recently released genome sequence of Castanea crenata [Shirasawa,2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/dnares/dsab016) was screened for MYBs [Pucker, 2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.10.16.464636). A large number of close homologs of AtMYB123 (TT2), a regulator of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis, was discovered. This could indicate that the PA biosynthesis is controlled in a very specific way in different tissues and under different conditions. Tissue-specific expression analyes could help to resolve this question.

[Lafferty et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erab460) investigated the regulation of anthocyanin and proanthocyanidin biosynthesis in blueberry (_Vaccinium corymbosum_) and bilberry (_V. myrtillus_). Blueberry has white flesh, while bilberry has red flesh indicating as difference in the anthocyanin biosynthesis regulation. While MYBPA1.1 and MYBA1 are both correlated with anthocyanin biosynthesis, they differ in their expression pattern. MYBPA1.1 is active during proanthocyanidin formation in early stages and anthocyanin formation during ripening. MYBA1 is a positive regulator of MYBPA1.1 which suggest that the lack of MYBA1 expression in blueberry flesh is the explanation for the lack of anthocyanin pigmentation. The authors speculate that such a hierarchical model could also be in place for other branches of the flavonoid biosynthesis.

[Li et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236565) investigated the influence of methyl jasmonate (MeJA) on suspended cells of _Glycyrrhiza uralensis_ via RNA-seq. The MeJA treatment resulted in increased C4H and CHS expression levels. Unfortunately, the orthologs of GlMYB4 and GlMYB88 in _Arabidopsis thaliana_ are not included in the phylogenetic analysis. Overexpression of MYB88 resulted in elevated gene expression of C4H and CHS. It seems that this also increased the total amount of produced flavonoids.

Expression of this gene aligns well with the observed pigmentation patterns. Co-expression with _CHS_, _CHI_, _DFR_, _ANS_, and several _GTs_ was checked. While this MYB influences the pigmentation pattern, additional factors might contribute as well.

[Thiedig et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/plphys/kiaa067) investigated AtSNAPc4 (At3g18100), which is a 4R-MYB. In contrast to the abundant R2R3-MYBs, this protein is characterized by four and a half MYB repeats. This protein is a subunit of the SNAP complex 4 that is involved in snRNA gene transcription. _Arabidopsis thaliana_, _Beta vulgaris_, _Vitis vinifera_, and many other plants have only a single copy of this 4R-MYB. This suggest that this single copy state is conserved through evolution. Four different transcript isoforms of At3g18100 are annotated in Araport11, but only one of them (AtSNAPc4.1) encodes a functional protein. Therefore, it is possible that the other three isoforms are targeted by the NMD pathway.

Overexpression of LoMYB33 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in reduced growth and had a negative impact on anther development. This resulted in a lower number of pollen grains and partial male sterility.

[Cavallini et al., 2015](http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/doi/10.1104/pp.114.256172) investigated the phenylpropanoid repressors of _Vitis vinifera_. The identified repressor MYBs were similar to the previously chracterized flavonoid repressors AtMYB4 and AtMYBL2. The _V. vinifera_ sequences were classified into groups that are similar to AtMYB4 and PhMYB4 (VvMYB4a and VvMYB4b) and those that are similar to FaMYB1 and PhMYB27 (VvMYBC2-L1, VvMYBC2-L2, and VvMYBC2-L3). A further subclassification was achieved based on the presence of various C-motifs. Fig. 1 of the publication by Cavallini et al., 2015 is an excellent summary. Heterologous expression in petunia was used to study the functions of different repressors. VvMYB4a and VvMYB4b repressed the general phenylpropanoid biosynthesis in petunia. _VvMYBC2-L1_ and _VvMYBC2-L3_ expression resulted in reduced petal anthocyanin content and reduced amount of proanthocyanidins in seeds.

</a>

[Wong et al., 2016](https://doi.org/10.1093/dnares/dsw028) performed a comprehensive analysis of the MYB transcription factors in grapevine. The annotation was manually improved based on information from RNA-seq datasets. Grapevines are well known for their production of stilbenes (anticarcinogenesis) and flavonoids (nutraceuticals). High production levels are based on gene duplications which include the regulating MYB transcription factors. MYBs associated with the flavonoid biosynthesis show patterns of selection that might be due to breeding over many generations. Several MYBs show alternative transcripts originating from the retention of introns. Many of these transcripts encode a disrupted DNA binding domain. Co-expression analyses were preformed to understand the functions of the grapevine MYBs. An enrichment among the most highly co-expressed genes of each MYB was used to predict a function. _VviMYB13_ was previously not characterized, but appeared co-expressed with the stilbene synthase activators _VviMYB14_ and _VviMYB15_. The expression domain of _VviMYB13_ is not identical with that of its close homolog _VviMYB15_. _VviMYB13_ expression in vegetative tissues under non-stress conditions appears to be responsible for the activation of stilbene biosynthesis. _VviMYB13_ might also be important for the activation of stilbene biosynthesis at the onset of ripening before _VviMYB14_ and _VviMYB15_ are active. _VviMYB13_ also showed a substantially faster and higher response to downy mildew infection than _VviMYB14_ or _VviMYB15_.

[Sun et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41438-021-00590-3) investigated an apple mutant that shows an enhanced skin coloration. RNA-seq revealed that a MYB90-like transcripiton factor is a putative key regulator due to substantially increased gene expression. This TF was able to bind to the promoters of _MdCHS_ and _MdUFGT_. Overexpression of this TF resulted in activation of anthocyanin-related genes. As no causal sequence variant was identified in this MYB, the authors assume that a difference in the methylation of the promoter region of this MYB is responsible for the expression difference.



### (49) Soybean seed coat pigmentation ###

</a>


[Gao et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1093/jxb/erab152) investigated the transcriptional regulation of the seed coat pigmentation in soybean (_Glycine max)_. Soybean is an important crop species for the production of oil and protein. Seeds show a complex pigmentation pattern. Especially dark seeds are expected to have health benefits. A phylogenetic analysis connected 15 MYB genes with the anthocyanin biosynthesis. GmMYBR belongs in a clade with C2 repressor MYBs. GmMYBA2 is a member of the anthoyanin activator clade. Expression patterns and transactivation assays suggested that GmMYBR is a repressor and GmMYBA2 is an activator of the anthocyanin biosynthesis. Overexpression of GmMYBA2 in the soybean cultivars Wm82 and P3 resulted in the accumulation of cyanidin derivatives and delphinidin derivatives, respectively. This suggest a difference in the F3'5'H activity between bloth cultivars. A single nucleotide deletion in the _F3'H_ of P3 caused a frameshift and resulted in a probably non-functional truncated protein. The _F3'5'H_ of Wm82 is probably also non-functional due to a premature stop codon. GmMYBR seems to repress the gene expression by binding the GmMYBA2-GmTT8a complex that would otherwise activate anthocyanin biosynthesis genes.
