## Introduction ##

MYB transcription factors are among the largest transcription factor families in plants. Especially the R2R3 clades expanded in plants. Members of this family are phylogenetically assigned to groups. Each group is assumed to control a specific function. Numerous processes are controlled by MYBs. Here is a list of the expected MYB functions in banana (Musa acuminata): (1) defense/stress response, (2) trichome branching and petal morphogenesis, (3) defense/stress response, (4) glucosinolates/camalexin, (5) suberin, (6) root development, (7) phenylpropanoid/lignin, (8) flower meristem identity, (10) abiotic stress response, flower morphogenesis, and stilbene biosynthesis, (11) photomorphogenesis, (12) anther and tapetum development, (14) axillary meristem and root growth, (15) SCW and lignin, (16) stemen/anther development, phenylpropanoid, SCW, (17) anther and trichome development, (18) SCW and lignin, (20) mucillage, lignin, and stomatal closure, (22) repressors of phenylpropanoid, sinapata, lignin, (23) general flavonoid biosynthesis and trichome development, (24)
